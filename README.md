# (In progress) An ecommerce mobile app written using Flutter.
The demo is live at: [https://foodapp-6f26f.web.app/]{https://foodapp-6f26f.web.app/}

- The app is responsive, it has support for 2 different screen sizes: mobile and desktop.
- The app is localized, it support 2 languages (Dutch and English). This was achieved using the `flutter_localizations`.
- The styling is mostly defined in the materialApp theme, so a coherent theme is used in the app that can be easily changed.
- Firebase integration for authentication and database.

The architecture documentation can be found in [architecture.md](architecture.md).
